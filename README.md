## Description

User story:

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

Acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

The motivation for this project was to build a express.js API to interact with a sql server and database managed using custom models and workbench sql editing software.
This project was built to help strengthen the concepts of object relational mapping, and to use sequleize to dynamically create table joins based on user input. The application features
three tables of information, related together through one-many and many-many relationships. All three categories can be accessed using two GET routes, a POST route, a PUT route, and a DELETE route. This application helps to solve the problem of navigating through user request and server responses translating data pertiaing to a simple e-commerce site. This isone of the fundentals for the full stack web development model. During this project, I practiced and learned the concepts of sql database management, express.js servers, try-catch methods, and sequelize models with relationships.
